PleskScan
=========

PleskScan is a Plesk panel identifying scanner, using it is pretty simple. But it requires you to do one change in your server configuration.
So before using the scanner please go and find you're php configuration file (PHP.ini) and uncomment line: extension=php_openssl.dll and that's pretty it.
Now you can start using the scanner, but keep in mind only scan servers you're allowed to ;)
